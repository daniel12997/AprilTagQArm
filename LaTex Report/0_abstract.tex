\begin{abstract}
In this project, we develop software enabling the QArm robot to pick up a tagged object and place it on a drop-off location. This is accomplished using April-Tags, which allows the localization of an object with respect to a camera's location. Using this information we can then transform the location of the object to the Base frame. This allows us to move the arm to pick up the object and place it on the drop-off location. Problems were encountered when implementing the readAprilTag() function into the Simulink Model. This was resolved by creating an external Matlab script that only performed the readAprilTag() function. The location of the object and drop-off were then inputed into the Simulink model where the QArm performed the pick and place automatically. Repeatability of the project was acceptable, though improvements to AprilTag detection and location can be improved.
