\section{Conclusion}

In general, we were able to accomplish most of the goals of this project. We were able to detect the AprilTags, convert their locations into the base frame, and pick up and drop off the object at the marked location. There were a couple of snags that we ran into during the project but we were able to accomplish the overall goals despite them. We were able to use the tags to identify the locations of the object and dropoff point and use them to gather the locations of each for pick-up and dropoff.
